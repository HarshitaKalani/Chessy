Requires: Python >=3.6.
To install, open a command prompt and launch:

To launch a server:
```bash

You can see the rules of the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor):

- To place a fence, click on the game board

At the end of the game, you can restart a game. Just click on the "Restart" button.

## Pathfinding algorithm
A pathfinding algorithm is used to check if a player is blocked or not. Thanks to the [python-pathfinding](https://github.com/brean/python-pathfinding) project.
